		<h1>Behaviorism</h1>
<p>Behaviorism was a movement in psychology and philosophy that 
emphasized the outward behavioral aspects of thought and dismissed the 
inward experiential, and sometimes the inner procedural, aspects as 
well; a movement harking back to the methodological proposals of John B.
 Watson, who coined the name.&nbsp; Watson's 1913 manifesto proposed 
abandoning Introspectionist attempts to make <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/consciou/">consciousness</a> a subject of experimental investigation to focus instead on <em>behavioral </em>manifestations
 of intelligence.&nbsp; B. F. Skinner later hardened behaviorist 
strictures to exclude inner physiological processes along with inward 
experiences as items of legitimate psychological concern.&nbsp; 
Consequently, the successful "cognitive revolution" of the nineteen 
sixties styled itself a revolt against behaviorism even though the <em>computational processes</em> cognitivism hypothesized would be public and objective -- not the sort of <em>private subjective </em>processes
 Watson banned.&nbsp; Consequently (and ironically), would-be-scientific
 champions of consciousness now indict cognitivism for <em>its</em> "behavioristic" neglect of inward experience.</p>
<p>The enduring philosophical interest of behaviorism concerns this <em>methodological</em> challenge to the scientific <em>bona fides</em> of consciousness (on behalf of empiricism) and, connectedly (in accord with materialism), its challenge to the supposed <em>metaphysical</em>
 inwardness, or subjectivity, of thought.&nbsp; Although behaviorism as 
an avowed movement may have few remaining advocates, various practices 
and trends in psychology and philosophy may still usefully be styled 
"behavioristic". As long as experimental rigor in psychology is held to 
require "operationalization" of variables, behaviorism's methodological 
mark remains.&nbsp; Recent attempts to revive doctrines of "ontological 
subjectivity" (Searle 1992) in philosophy and bring "consciousness 
research" under the aegis of Cognitive Science (see Horgan 1994) point 
up the continuing relevance of behaviorism's metaphysical and 
methodological challenges.</p>

<h2><a name="H1"></a> 1. Behaviorists and Behaviorisms</h2>
<p>Behaviorism, notoriously, came in various sorts and has been, also 
notoriously, subject to variant sortings: "the variety of positions that
 constitute behaviorism" might even be said to share no 
common-distinctive property, but only "a loose family resemblance" 
(Zuriff 1985: 1) . Views commonly styled "behavioristic" share various 
of the following marks:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Among these features, not even Zuriff's "fundamental premise" is 
shared by all (and only) behaviorists. Notably, Gilbert Ryle, Ludwig 
Wittgenstein, and followers in the "ordinary language" tradition of 
analytic philosophy, while, for the most part, regarding behavioral <em>scientific</em>
 hopes as vain, hold views that are, in other respects, strongly 
behavioristic. Not surprisingly, these thinkers often downplay the 
"behaviorist" label themselves to distinguish themselves from their <em>scientific </em>behaviorist
 cousins. Nevertheless, in philosophical discussions, they are commonly 
counted "behaviorists": both emphasize the external behavioral aspects, 
deemphasize inward experiential and inner procedural aspects, and offer 
broadly behavioral-dispositional construals of thought.</p>
<h3><a name="SH1a"></a> a. Psychological Behaviorists</h3>
<h4><a name="SSH1a.i"></a> i. Precursors: Wilhelm Wundt, Ivan Pavlov</h4>
<p>Wundt is often called "the father of experimental psychology." He 
conceived the subject matter of psychology to be "experience in its 
relations to the subject" (Wundt 1897: 3). The science of experience he 
envisaged was supposed to be chemistry like: introspected experiential 
data were to be analyzed; the basic constituents of conscious experience
 thus identified; and the patterns and laws by which these basic 
constituents combine to constitute more complex conscious experiences 
(e.g., emotions) described. Data were to be acquired and analyzed by 
trained introspective Observers. While the analysis of experience was 
supposed to be a self-contained enterprise, Wundt -- originally trained 
as a physiologist -- fully expected that the structures and processes 
introspective analysis uncovered in experience would parallel structures
 and processes physiological investigation revealed in the central 
nervous system. Introspectionism, as the approach was called, soon 
spread, and laboratories sprang up in the United States and elsewhere, 
aiming "to investigate the facts of consciousness, its combinations and 
relations," so as to "ultimately discover the laws which govern these 
relations and combinations" (Wundt 1912: 1). The approach failed 
primarily due to the unreliability of introspective Observation. 
Introspective "experimental" results were not reliably reproducible by 
outside laboratories: Observers from different laboratories failed to 
agree, for instance, in their Observation (or failure to Observe) 
imageless thoughts (to cite one notorious controversy).</p>
<p>Pavlov's successful experimental discovery the laws of <em>classical conditioning </em>(as they came to be called), by way of contrast, provided positive inspiration for Watson's Behaviorist manifesto. Pavlov's <em>stimulus-response</em>
 model of explanation is also paradigmatic to much later behavioristic 
thought. In his famous experiments Pavlov paired presentations to dogs 
of an unconditioned stimulus (food) with an initially neutral stimulus 
(a ringing bell). After a number of such joint presentations, the <em>unconditional response </em>to food (<em>salivation</em>) becomes <em>conditioned</em>
 to the bell: salivation occurs upon the ringing of the bell alone, in 
the absence of food. In accord with Pavlovian theory, then, <em>given an animal's conditioning history </em>behavioral
 responses (e.g., salivation) can be predicted to occur or not, and be 
controlled (made to occur or not), on the basis of laws of conditioning,
 answering to the stimulus-response pattern:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>S -&gt; R</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Everything adverted to here is publicly observable, even measurable; 
enabling Pavlov to experimentally investigate and formulate laws 
concerning temporal sequencing and delay effects, stimulus intensity 
effects, and stimulus generalization (opening doors to experimental 
investigation of animal perception and discrimination).</p>
<p>Edward Thorndike, in a similar methodological vein, proposed "that 
psychology may be, at least in part, as independent of introspection as 
physics" (Thorndike 1911: 5) and pursued experimental investigations of 
animal intelligence. In experimental investigations of puzzle-solving by
 cats and other animals, he established that speed of solution increased
 gradually as a result of previous puzzle exposure. Such results, he 
maintained, support the hypothesis that learning is a result of habits 
formed through trial and error, and Thorndike formulated "laws of 
behavior," describing habit formation processes, based on these results.
 Most notable among Thorndike's laws (presaging Skinnerian <em>operant conditioning</em>) is his <em>Law of Effect</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Of several responses made to the same situation, 
those which are accompanied or closely followed by satisfaction to the 
animal will, other things being equal, be more firmly connected with the
 situation, so that, when it recurs, they will be more likely to recur; 
those which are accompanied or closely followed by discomfort to the 
animal will, other things being equal, have their connections with that 
situation weakened, so that, when it recurs, they will be less likely to
 occur. The greater the satisfaction or discomfort, the greater the 
strengthening or weakening of the bond</em> . (Thorndike 1911)</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, rewarded responses tend to be <em>reinforced</em> and 
punished responses eliminated. His methodological innovations 
(particularly his "puzzle-box") facilitated objective quantitative data 
collection and provided a paradigm for Behaviorist research methods to 
follow (especially the "Skinner box").</p>
<h4><a name="SSH1a.ii"></a> ii. John B. Watson: Early Behaviorism</h4>
<p><a name="watson"></a>Watson coined the term "Behaviorism" as a name 
for his proposal to revolutionize the study of human psychology in order
 to put it on a firm experimental footing. In opposition to received 
philosophical opinion, to the dominant Introspectionist approach in 
psychology, and (many said) to common sense, Watson (1913) advocated a 
radically different approach. Where received "wisdom" took <em>conscious experience</em>
 to be the very stuff of minds and hence the (only) appropriate object 
of psychological investigation, Watson advocated an approach that led, 
scientifically, "to the ignoring of consciousness" and the illegitimacy 
of "making consciousness a special object of observation." He proposed, 
instead, that psychology should "take as a starting point, first the 
observable fact that organisms, man and animal alike, do adjust 
themselves to their environment" and "secondly, that certain stimuli 
lead the organisms to make responses." Whereas Introspectionism had, in 
Watson's estimation, miserably <em>failed</em> in its attempt to make 
experimental science out of subjective experience, the laboratories of 
animal psychologists, such as Pavlov and Thorndike, were already 
achieving reliably reproducible results and discovering general 
explanatory principles. Consequently, Watson -- trained as an "animal 
man" himself -- proposed, "making behavior, not consciousness, the 
objective point of our attack" as the key to putting the study of <em>human</em>
 psychology on a similar scientific footing. Key it proved to be. 
Watson's revolution was a smashing success. Introspectionism languished,
 behaviorism flourished, and considerable areas of our understanding of 
human psychology (particularly with regard to <em>learning</em>) came 
within the purview of experimental investigation along broadly 
behavioristic lines. Notably, also, Watson foreshadows Skinner's ban on 
appeals to inner (central nervous) processes, seeming to share the 
Skinnerian sentiment "that because so little is known about the central 
nervous system, it serves as the last refuge of the soul in psychology" 
(Zuriff 1985: 80). Watson is, consequently, loath to hypothesize central
 processes, going so far as to speculate that thought occurs <em>in the vocal tract</em>, and is -- quite <em>literally</em> -- subaudible talking to oneself (Watson 1920).</p>
<h4><a name="SSH1a.iii"></a> iii. Intermediaries: Edward Tolman and Clark Hull</h4>
<p>Tolman and Hull were the two most noteworthy figures of the 
movement's middle years. Although both accepted the S-R framework as 
basic, Tolman and Hull were far more willing than Watson to hypothesize 
internal mechanisms or "intervening variables" mediating the S-R 
connection. In this regard their work may be considered precursory to 
cognitivism, and each touches on important philosophical issues besides.
 Tolman's <em>purposive behaviorism</em> attempts to explain 
goal-directed or purposive behavior, focusing on large, intact, 
meaningful behavior patterns or "molar" behavior (e.g., kicking a ball) 
as opposed to simple muscle movements or "molecular" behavior (e.g., 
various flexings of leg muscles); regarding the molecular level as too 
far removed from our perceptual capacities and explanatory purposes to 
provide suitable units for meaningful behavioral analysis. For Tolman, 
stimuli play a cognitive role as signals to the organism, leading to the
 formation of "cognitive maps" and to "latent learning" in the absence 
of reinforcement. Overall,</p>
<blockquote><p>The stimuli which are allowed in are not connected by 
just simple one-to-one switches to the outgoing responses. Rather the 
incoming impulses are usually worked over and elaborated in the central 
control room into a tentative cognitive-like map of the environment. And
 it is this tentative map, indicating routes and paths and environmental
 relationships, which finally determines what responses, if any, the 
animal will finally make. (Tolman 1948: 192)</p></blockquote>
<p>Clark Hull undertook the ambitious program of formulating an 
exhaustive theory of such mechanisms intervening between stimuli and 
responses: the theory was to take the form of a hypothetical-deductive 
system of basic laws or "postulates" enabling the prediction of 
behavioral responses (as "output variables") on the basis of external 
stimuli ("input variables") plus internal states of the organism 
("intervening variables"). Including such organismic "intervening" 
variables (O) in the predictive/explanatory laws results in the 
following revised explanatory schema:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>S &amp; O -&gt; R</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The intervening <em>O-variables</em> Hull hypothesized included <em>drive</em> and <em>habit strength</em>.
 Attributes of, and relations among, these variables are what the 
postulates describe: further attributes and relationships were derived 
as theorems and corollaries from the basic postulates. Hull's student, 
Edward Spence, attempted to carry on with the program, without lasting 
success. Expected gains in predictive-explanatory scope and precision 
were not achieved and, with hindsight, it is easy to see that such an 
elaborate theoretical superstructure, built on such slight 
observational-experimental foundations, was bound to fall. Hull's 
specific proposals are presently more historical curiosities than live 
hypotheses. Nevertheless, currently prevalent cognitivist approaches 
share Hull's general commitment to internal mechanisms.</p>
<h4><a name="SSH1a.iv"></a> iv. B. F. Skinner: Radical Behaviorism</h4>
<p>Skinner's self-described "radical behaviorist" approach is radical in
 its insistence on extending behaviorist strictures against <em>inward experiential</em> processes to include <em>inner physiological </em>ones as well. The scientific nub of the approach is a concept of <em>operant conditioning </em>indebted to Thorndike's "Law of Effect." <em>Operants</em>
 (e.g., bar-presses or key-pecks) are units of behavior an organism 
(e.g., a rat or pigeon) occasionally emits "spontaneously" prior to 
conditioning. In operant conditioning, operants followed by <em>reinforcement </em>(e.g., food or water) increase in frequency and come under control of <em>discriminative stimuli </em>(e.g.,
 lights or tones) preceding the response. By increasingly judicious 
reinforcement of increasingly close approximations, complex behavioral 
sequences are <em>shaped.</em> On Skinner's view, high-level human 
behavior, such as speech, is the end result of such shaping. Prolonged 
absence of reinforcement leads to <em>extinction</em> of the response. 
Many original and important Skinnerian findings -- e.g., that constantly
 reinforced responses extinguish more rapidly than intermittently 
reinforced responses -- concern the effects of differing <em>schedules of reinforcement</em>. Skinner notes the similarity of operant behavioral conditioning to natural evolutionary selection: in each case apparently <em>forward</em>-looking or goal-directed developments are explained (away) by a <em>preceding</em>
 course of environmental "selection" among randomly varying evolutionary
 traits or, in the psychological case, behavioral tricks. The 
purposiveness which Tolman's molar behavioral description <em>assumes</em>, radical behaviorism thus claims to <em>explain</em>.
 Likewise, Skinner questions the explanatory utility of would-be 
characterizations of inner processes (such as Hull's): such processes, 
being <em>behavior</em> themselves (though inner), are more in need of 
explanation themselves, Skinner holds, than they are fit to explain 
outward behavior. By "dismissing mental states and processes," Skinner 
maintains, radical behaviorism "directs attention to the ... history of 
the individual and to the current environment where the real causes of 
behavior are to be found" (Skinner 1987: 75). On this view, "if the 
proper attention is paid to the variables controlling behavior and an 
appropriate behavioral unit is chosen, orderliness appears directly in 
the behavior and the postulated theoretical processes become 
superfluous" (Zuriff: 88). Thus understood, Skinner's complaint about 
inner processes "is not that they do not exist, but that they are not 
relevant" (Skinner 1953) to the prediction, control, and experimental 
analysis of behavior.</p>
<p>Skinner stressed <em>prediction </em>and <em>control </em>as his 
chief explanatory desiderata, and on this score he boasts that 
"experimental analysis of behaviour" on radical behaviorist lines "has 
led to an effective technology, applicable to education, psychotherapy, 
and the design of cultural practices in general" (Skinner 1987: 75). 
Even the most strident critics of radical behaviorism, I believe, must 
accord it some recognition in these connections. <em>Behavior therapy</em> (based on operant principles) has proven effective in treating phobias and addictions; operant <em>shaping </em>is
 widely and effectively used in animal training; and behaviorist 
instructional methods have proven effective -- though they may have 
become less fashionable -- in the field of education. Skinnerian 
Behaviorism can further boast of significantly advancing our 
understanding of <em>stimulus generalization</em> and other important 
learning-and-perception related phenomena and effects. Nevertheless, 
what was delivered was less than advertised. In particular, Skinner's 
attempt to extend the approach to the explanation of high-grade human 
behavior failed, making Noam Chomsky's dismissive (1959) review of 
Skinner's book, <em>Verbal Behavior</em>, something of a watershed. On Chomsky's diagnosis, not only <em>had</em> Skinner's attempt at explaining verbal behavior failed, it <em>had to fail</em>
 given the insufficiency of the explanatory devices Skinner allowed: 
linguistic competence (in general) and language acquisition (in 
particular), Chomsky argued, can only be explained as expressions of <em>innate mechanisms</em> -- presumably, <em>computational </em>mechanisms.
 For those in the "behavioral sciences" already chaffing under the 
severe methodological constraints Skinnerian orthodoxy imposed, the 
transition to "cognitive science" was swift and welcome. By 1985 Zuriff 
would write, "the received wisdom of today is that behaviorism has been 
refuted, its methods have failed, and it has little to offer modern 
psychology" (Zuriff 1985: 278). Subsequent developments, however, 
suggest that matters are not that simple.</p>
<h4><a name="SSH1a.v"></a> v. Post-Behaviorist and Neo-behavioristic Currents: Externalism and Connectionism</h4>
<p>Several recent developments inside and beside the mainstream of 
"cognitive science" -- though their proponents have not been keen to 
style themselves "behaviorists" -- appear to be rather behavioristic. <em>Semantic externalism</em>
 is the view that "meanings ain't in the head" (Putnam 1975: 227) but 
depend, rather, on environmental factors; especially on sensory and 
behavioral intercourse with the referents of the referring thoughts or 
expressions. If emphasis on the outward or behavioral aspects of thought
 or intelligence -- and attendant de-emphasis of inward experiential or 
inner procedural aspects -- is the hallmark of behaviorism, semantic 
externalism is, on its face, behavioristic (though this is seldom 
remarked). Emphasis (as by Burge 1979) on social (besides the indexical,
 or sensory-behavioral) determinants of reference -- on what Putnam 
called "the linguistic division of labor" -- lends this view a distinct 
Wittgensteinean flavor besides. Such externalist "causal theories" of 
reference, although far from unquestioned orthodoxy, are currently among
 the leading cognitive scientific contenders. Less orthodox, but even 
more behavioristic, is the <em>procedural externalism </em>advocated by 
Andy Clark (2001), inspired by work in "Situated Cognition, Distributed 
and Decentralized Cognition, Real-World Robotics, and Artificial Life" 
(Clark 2001: abstract); identifying thought with "complex and iterated 
processes which continually loop between brain, body, and technological 
environment"; according to which the "intelligent process just<em> is </em>the
 spatially and temporally extended one which zig-zags between brain, 
body, and world" (Clark 2001: 132). Perhaps most importantly, the 
influential <em><a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/connect/">connectionist </a></em><a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/connect/">hypothesis</a>
 that the brain does parallel processing of distributed representations,
 rather than serial processing of localized (language-like) 
representations, also waxes behavioristic. In parallel systems, 
typically, initial programming (comparable to innate mechanisms) is 
minimal and the systems are "trained-up" to perform complex tasks over a
 series of trails, by a process somewhat like operant shaping.</p>
<h3><a name="SH1b"></a> b. Philosophical Behaviorists</h3>
<p><a name="Philosophical Behaviorism"></a></p>
<h4><a name="SSH1b.i"></a> i. Precursors, Preceptors, &amp; Fellow Travelers: William James, John Dewey, Bertrand Russell</h4>
<p><a name="preceptors"></a> In opposition to the "Structuralist" 
philosophical underpinnings of introspectionism, behaviorism grew out of
 a competing "Functionalist" philosophy of psychology that counted Dewey
 and William James among its leading advocates. Against structuralist 
reification of the <em>content </em>of experience, Dewey urged that 
sensations be given a functional characterization, and proposed to treat
 them as functionally defined occupants of roles in the "reflex arc" 
which -- since it "represents both the unit of nerve structure and the 
type of nerve function" -- should supply the "unifying principle and 
controlling working hypothesis in psychology" (Dewey 1896: 357); though 
the arc, Dewey insisted, is misunderstood if not viewed in broader 
organic-adaptive context. On another front -- against structuralist 
reification of the <em>subject</em> of experience -- William James famously maintained,</p>
<blockquote><p>that 'consciousness,' when once it has evaporated to this
 estate of pure diaphaneity, is on the point of disappearing altogether.
 It is the name of a nonentity, and has no right to a place among first 
principles. Those who still cling to it are clinging to a mere echo, the
 faint rumor left behind by the disappearing 'soul' upon the air of 
philosophy.</p></blockquote>
<p>James hastened to add, that he meant "only to deny that the word 
[`consciousness'] stands for an entity, but to insist most emphatically 
that it does stand for a function" (James 1912). The James-Lange theory 
of emotions -- which holds that "<em>the bodily changes follow directly the </em>PERCEPTION<em> of the exciting fact, and that our feeling of the same changes as they occur </em>IS<em> the emotion</em> (James 1884: 189-190) -- prefigures later behavioristic deflationary analyses of other categories of presumed mentation.</p>
<p>Bertrand Russell was among the first philosophers to recognize the 
philosophical significance of the behaviorist revolution Watson 
proposed. Though never a card-carrying behaviorist himself -- insisting 
that the inwardness or "privacy" of "sense-data" "does not by itself 
make [them] unamenable to scientific treatment" (Russell 1921: 119) -- 
Russell, nevertheless, asserted that behaviorism "contains much more 
truth than people suppose" and regarded it "as desirable to develop the 
behaviourist method to the fullest possible extent" (Russell 1927: 73), 
proposing a united front between behaviorism and science-friendly <em>analytic philosophy</em>
 of mind. Such fronts soon emerged on both the "formal language" and 
"ordinary language" sides of ongoing analytic philosophical debate.</p>
<h4><a name="SSH1b.ii"></a> ii. Logical Behaviorism: Rudolf Carnap</h4>
<p>What is sometimes called the "formalist" or "ideal language" line of 
analytic philosophy seeks the logical and empirical regimentation of 
(would-be) scientific language for the sake of its scientific 
improvement. "Logical behaviorism" refers, most properly, to Carnap and 
Hempel's proposed regimentation of psychological discourse on 
behavioristic lines, calling for analyses of mental terms along lines 
consonant with the Logical Empiricist doctrine of <em>verificationism</em> (resembling the "operationism" of P.W. Bridgman 1927) they espoused. According to verificationism, a <em>theoretic</em> attribution -- say of <em>temperature</em>
 -- as in "it's 23.4º centigrade" "affirms nothing other than" that 
certain "physical test sentences obtain": sentences describing the 
would-be "coincidence between the level of the mercury and the mark of 
the scale numbered 23.4" on a mercury thermometer, and "other 
coincidences," for other measuring instruments (Hempel 1949: 16-17). 
Similarly, it was proposed, that for scientific psychological purposes, 
"the meaning of a psychological statement consists solely in the 
function of abbreviating the description of certain modes of physical 
response characteristic of the bodies of men and animals" (Hempel 1949: 
19), the modes of physical response by which we test the truth of our 
psychological attributions. "Paul has a toothache" for instance would 
abbreviate "Paul weeps and makes gestures of such and such kinds"; "At 
the question `What is the matter?,' Paul utters the words `I have a 
toothache'"; and so on (Hempel 1949: 17). As Carnap and Hempel came to 
give up verificationism, they gave up logical behaviorism, and came to 
hold, instead, that "the introduction and application of psychological 
terms and hypotheses is logically and methodologically analogous to the 
introduction and application of the terms and hypotheses of a physical 
theory." Theoretical terms on this newly emerging (and now prevalent) 
view need only be <em>loosely</em> tied to observational tests<em> in concert</em>
 with other terms of the theory. They needn't be fully characterized, 
each in terms of its own observations, as on the "narrow translationist"
 (Hempel 1977: 14) doctrine of logical behaviorism. As verificationism 
went, so went logical behaviorism: liberalized requirements for the 
empirical grounding of theoretical posits encouraged the taking of 
"cognitive scientific" liberties (in practice) and (in theory) the 
growth of cognitivist sympathies among analytic philosophers of mind. 
Still, despite having been renounced by its champions as unfounded and 
having found no new champions; and despite seeming, with hindsight, 
clearly false; logical behaviorism continues to provoke philosophical 
discussion, perhaps due to that very clarity. Appreciation of <em>how </em>logical behaviorism went wrong (<a href="#Objections%20&amp;%20Discussion">below</a>)
 is widely regarded by cognitivists as the best propaedeutic to their 
case for robust recourse to hypotheses about internal computational 
mechanisms.</p>
<h4><a name="SSH1b.iii"></a> iii. Ordinary Language Behaviorists: Gilbert Ryle, Ludwig Wittgenstein</h4>
<p>The "ordinary language" movement waxed most strongly in the work of 
Ryle and Wittgenstein around the middle of the twentieth century. Their 
investigations are "meant to throw light on the facts of our language" 
in its everyday employment (Wittgenstein 1953: §130). Where the 
formalist seeks the logical and empirical regimentation of would-be 
scientific language, including psychological terms, Ryle and 
Wittgenstein regard our everyday use of mental terminology as 
unimpeached by its scientific "defects" ... which are <em>not</em> 
defects ... because such talk is not in the scientific line of business.
 To misconstrue talk of people "as knowing, believing, or guessing 
something, as hoping, dreading, intending or shirking something, as 
designing this or being amused at that" (Ryle 1949: 15) on the model of 
scientific hypotheses about inner mechanisms misconstrues the "logical 
grammar" (Wittgenstein) of such talk, or makes a "category-mistake" 
(Ryle). Philosophical puzzlements about knowledge of other minds and 
mind-body interaction arise from such misconstrual: for instance, 
attempts to solve the mind-body problem, Ryle claims, "presuppose the 
legitimacy of the disjunction `Either there exist minds or there exist 
bodies (but not both)'" which "would be like saying, `Either she bought a
 left-hand and a right-hand glove or she bought a pair of gloves (but 
not both)'" (Ryle 1949: 22-3). The most basic misconstrual 
(Wittgenstein's and Ryle's diagnoses concur) involves thinking -- when 
we talk of "knowing, believing, or guessing," etc. -- "that these verbs 
are supposed to denote the occurrence of specific modifications" either 
mechanical (in brains) or "paramechanical" (in streams of 
consciousness):</p>
<blockquote><p>So we have to deny the yet uncomprehended process in the 
yet unexplored medium. And now it looks as if we have denied the mental 
processes. And naturally we don't want to deny them." (Wittgenstein 
1953: §308)</p></blockquote>
<p>Not wanting to deny, e.g., "that anyone ever remembers anything" 
(Wittgenstein 1953: §306) Wittgenstein and Ryle offer broadly 
dispositional stories about how mentalistic talk <em>does</em> work, in place of "the model of 'object and designation'" (Wittgenstein 1953: §293) they reject.</p>
<p>According to Wittgenstein on the object-designation model -- where the object is supposed to be<em> private</em>
 or introspected -- it "drops out of consideration as irrelevant" 
(Wittgenstein 1953: §293): the "essential thing about private 
experience" here is "not that each person possesses his own exemplar" 
but "that nobody knows whether other people also have this or something 
else" (§272). So, if "someone tells me that he knows what pain is only 
from his own case" this would be as if</p>
<blockquote><p>everyone had a box with something in it: we call it a 
`beetle'. No one can look in anyone else's box, and everyone says he 
knows what a beetle is only by looking at his beetle. -- Here it would 
be quite possible for everyone to have something different in his box. 
One might even imagine such a thing constantly changing. -- But suppose 
the word `beetle' had a use in these people's language? -- If so, it 
would not be used as the name of a thing. The thing in the box has no 
place in the language-game at all; not even as a something: for the box 
might even be empty. -- No, one can `divide through' by the thing in the
 box; it cancels out, whatever it is. (§293)</p></blockquote>
<p>Rather than referring to inner experiences, sensation words, 
according to Wittgenstein, "are connected with the primitive, the 
natural, expressions of the sensation and used in their place" (§246): 
self-attributions of "pain" and other sensation terms are <em>avowals</em>
 not descriptions: "A child has hurt himself and he cries; and then 
adults talk to him and teach him exclamations and, later, sentences. 
They teach the child new pain-behaviour." Here, Wittgenstein explains, 
he is not "saying that the word `pain' really means crying": rather, 
"the verbal expression of pain replaces crying and does not describe it"
 (§244). Avowals join the "natural expressions" to supply the "outward 
criteria" which <em>logically</em> (not just evidentially) constrain and
 enable the uses sensation and other "`inner process'" words have in our
 public language (§580). Furthermore, Wittgenstein famously argues, we 
cannot even coherently imagine a <em>private language </em>"in which a 
person could write down or give vocal expression to his inner 
experiences" exclusively "for his private use" because the "private 
ostensive definition" (§380) required to fix the reference of the 
would-be sensation-denoting expression could not establish a <em>rule</em>
 for its use. "To think one is obeying a rule is not to obey a rule" and
 in the case of usage consequent on the envisaged private baptism 
"thinking one was obeying a rule would be the same thing as ... obeying"
 (§202).</p>
<p>For Ryle, when we employ the "verbs, nouns and adjectives, with which
 in ordinary life we describe the wits, characters, and higher-grade 
performances of people with whom we have do" (Ryle 1949: 15) "we are not
 referring to occult episodes of which their overt acts and utterances 
are effects; we are referring to those overt acts and utterances 
themselves" (25) or else to a "disposition, or a complex of 
dispositions" (15) to such acts and utterances. "Dispositional words 
like `know', `believe', `aspire', `clever', and `humorous''' signify 
multi-track dispositions: "abilities, tendencies or pronenesses to do, 
not things of one unique kind, but things of lots of different kinds" 
(118): "to explain an action as done from a specified motive or 
inclination is not to describe the action as the effect of a specified 
cause": being dispositions, motives "are not happenings and are not 
therefore of the right type to be causes" (113). Accordingly, "to 
explain an act as done from a certain motive is not analogous to saying 
that the glass broke, because a stone hit it, but to the quite different
 type of statement that the glass broke, when the stone hit it, because 
the glass was brittle" (87). The force of such explanation is not "to 
correlate [the action explained] with some occult cause, but to subsume 
it under a propensity or behavior trend" (110). The explanation does not
 prescind from the act to its causal antecedents but redescribes the act
 in broader context, telling "a more pregnant story," as when we explain
 the bird's "flying south" as "migration"; yet, Ryle observes," the 
process of migrating is not a different process from that of flying 
south; so it is not the cause of its flying south" (142). Finally, the 
connection between disposition and deed, as Ryle understands it, is a <em>logical-criterial, </em>not a contingent-causal one: brave deeds are not <em>caused by</em> bravery, they <em>constitute</em> it (as the "soporific virtue," or sleep-inducing power, of opium doesn't <em>cause</em> it to induce sleep since tending to induce sleep <em>is</em> this power or "virtue").</p>
<h4><a name="SSH1b.iv"></a> iv. Reasons , Causes, and the Scientific Imperative</h4>
<p>For formalists, the informality and imprecision of ordinary language 
formulations invite criticism. Take Ryle's "migration" comparison: 
either, it would seem, Ryle is saying that everyday psychological 
explanations yield only vague interpretive understanding, having no 
scope for scientific development; or else, it would seem, the "more 
pregnant story" must be formalizable in terms of predictive-explanatory 
laws (as of migration, in Ryle's example) with 
logical-behaviorial-definition-like rigor (if not content). The point of
 <em>logical</em> behaviorist analysis is to scientifically ground talk 
of "belief," "desire," "sensation," and the rest, whose everyday use 
seems empirically precarious. With this aim in mind, "explanatory" 
procession from low-level matter-of-fact description ("flying south") to
 more interpretive description ("migration"), such as Ryle envisages, 
seems to move in the wrong direction ... unless, again, the "more 
pregnant story" is not just<em> redescriptive </em>but delivers <em>scientific theoretic</em>
 gains in the form of more general and precise explantory-predictive 
laws. A related debate raged fiercely through the nineteen fifties and 
early sixties between defenders of the (would-be) scientific status of 
"motive" or "belief-desire" explanations (notably Hempel) and champions 
of the Rylean thesis that "reasons aren't causes" (Elizabeth Anscombe 
and Stuart Hampshire, among them). Donald Davidson's (1963) defense of 
"the ancient -- and commonsense -- position that rationalization is a 
species of causal explanation" is widely recognized as a watershed in 
this debate, though it remains doubtful to what extent cognivists retain
 rights to the water shed, since Davidson counts reasons to be causal in
 virtue of noncognitive (low-level physical) properties. On the other 
hand, philosophers in the ordinary language tradition (e.g., Hampshire 
1950, Geach 1957) raised daunting technical difficulties (<a href="#Objections%20&amp;%20Discussion">below</a>) for the "narrow translationist" plans of logical behaviorism. Such criticisms hastened the advent of <em>cognitivism</em> as an alternative to behaviorism of <em>any</em>
 stripe among philosophers unwilling to abide the informality, 
imprecision, and seeming scientific defeatism of the ordinary language 
approach.</p>
<h4><a name="SSH1b.v"></a> v. Later Day Saints: Willard van Orman Quine and Alan Turing</h4>
<p><a name="Later Day Saints"></a> Quine, considered by many to be the 
greatest Anglo-American philosopher of the last half of the twentieth 
century, was a self-avowed "behaviorist," and such tendencies are 
evident in several areas of his thought, beginning with his enthusiasm 
for a <em>linguistic turn </em>(as Bergmann 1964 styled it: see Rorty 
1967) in the philosophy of mind. "A theory of mind," Quine writes, "can 
gain clarity and substance ... from a better understanding of the 
workings of language, whereas little understanding of the working of 
language is to be hoped for in mentalistic terms" (Quine 1975: 84). 
Quine's "naturalized" inquiries concerning knowledge and language 
attempt, further, to incorporate empirical findings and methods from 
Skinnerian psychology. In contrast to logical behaviorism (above), 
notably, Quine "never ... aspired to the ascetic adherence to 
operational definitions" and always acknowledged -- indeed <em>insisted </em>--
 that science "settles for partial criteria and for partial 
explanations" of its theoretic posits "in terms of other partially 
explained notions" (Quine 1990: 291). Still, he is not keen -- as his 
cognitivist contemporaries (for example, Putnam) and followers (for 
example, <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/fodor/">Fodor</a>) are -- about
 the prospects such looser empiricist strictures offer for scientific 
deployment of mentalistic vernacular terms like "belief," "desire," and 
"sensation". To standard behaviorist concern about the <em>empirical </em>credentials
 of alleged private entities and introspective reports, Quine adds the 
consideration that talk of "belief", "desire", and other <em>intentional </em>mental
 states is so logically ill-behaved as to be irreconcilable with 
materialism and scientifically unredeemable. In the final analysis, 
however, the behaviorism Quine proposes is methodological. His final 
metaphysical word is <em>physicalism</em>: "having construed behavioral 
dispositions in turn as physiological states, I end up with the so 
called identity theory of mind: mental states are states of the body" 
(Quine 1975: 94); yet, his <em>antiessentialism</em> here (as elsewhere) lends his physicalism a behavioristic cast (see next section).</p>
<p>Alan Turing is transitional. Along with the digital age, his theory 
of computation helped inspire the cognitivist revolution, making him, by
 some lights the first cognitivist. On the other hand, the <em>methodological </em>behaviorism
 of Turing's proposed Imitation Game test for artificial intelligence 
(the "Turing test") has been widely remarked and "the Turing test 
conception" of intelligence may be considered a parade case of <em>metaphysical</em> behaviorism for purposes of refutation (as by Block 1981) or illustration (as follows).</p>
<h4><a name="SSH1b.vi"></a> vi. The Turing Test Conception: Behaviorism as Metaphysical Null Hypothesis</h4>
<p><a name="Turing Test"></a> The Imitation Game proposed by Turing 
(1950) was originally a game of female impersonation: the aim of the 
game for the (male) querant is to pass for (that is, be judged by the 
questioner to be) female. The Turing test replaces the male querant with
 a computer whose aim is to pass for human. This simplified setup 
(Turing's actual proposal involves an additional complication, a third 
participant or <em>foil</em> besides to the <em>querant</em> and<em> questioner</em>)
 can be used to explain the metaphysical character of the dispute as a 
dispute about essence. In the original (man-woman) Imitation Game, 
notice, however good the impersonation, it doesn't <em>make</em> the querant female. Something else is essential: it's the content of their <em>chromosomes</em> (not their conversation) that <em>makes</em> the querant female or not. Different proposals for what that essential something is <em>in the case of thought</em>, then, represent different metaphysical takes on the nature of mind. In the Turing test scenario these different [<em>proposed essences</em>] represent further conditions <em>necessary</em> to promote intelligent-seeming behavior into actual intelligence, and <em>sufficing </em>for intelligence, or mentation, even in the absence of such behavior.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Dualistic Essentialism:</strong> S -&gt; [(the right) <em>conscious experiential processes</em>] -&gt; R<br>
<strong>Physicalistic Essentialism:</strong> S -&gt; [(the right) <em>physical processes</em>] -&gt; R<br>
<strong>Cognitivistic Essentialism:</strong> S -&gt; [(the right) <em>computational processess</em>] -&gt; R<br>
<strong>Behavioristic Inessentialism:</strong> S -&gt; [whatever works] -&gt; R</p></blockquote>
<p>Dualistic theories propose a conscious experiential essence; 
physicalistic (or "mind-brain identity") theories propose a physical 
(specifically, neurophysiological) essence; and cognitivistic theories a
 procedural or computational essence. Behaviorism, in contrast, <em>doesn't care</em> what mediates the intelligent-seeming S -&gt; R connection; behavioristically speaking, intelligence <em>is </em>as intelligence <em>does </em>regardless
 of the manner of the doing (experiential, neurophysiological, 
computational, or otherwise). Behaviorism, thus construed, "is not a 
metaphysical theory: it is the denial of a metaphysical theory" and 
consequently "asserts nothing" (Ziff 1958: 136); at least, nothing 
positively metaphysical.</p>
<h4><a name="SSH1b.vii"></a> vii. Logical Behaviorism Metaphysically Construed</h4>
<p><a name="Logical Behaviorism Metaphysically Construed"></a> Logical behaviorism may be seen, in the light of the preceding, as attempting to stipulate <em>nominal</em> <em>essences</em> (Locke 1690: IIiii15) where dualism, physicalism, and cognitivism propose to discover <em>real</em>
 ones. Further, although the motives of its founders (Carnap and Hempel)
 were chiefly epistemic or "methodological," logical behaviorism seemed 
to many to invite metaphysical exploitation. Because the <em>definitions</em>
 Carnap and Hempel proposed sought to specify observationally necessary 
and sufficient conditions for true attributions of the mental terms in 
what they called "the physical thing language," the successful 
completion of this program, it seemed, would <em>reduce</em> the mental to the physical. Mentalistic descriptions of people as "<em>expecting</em> pain" or "having <em>toothaches</em>"
 would be completely replaceable, in principle and without cognitive 
loss, by talk of bodily transitions; thoughts and experiences would thus
 be shown to be nothing above and beyond such bodily transitions; 
vindicating materialism. As the the methodological emphasis of early 
analytic philosophy receded and was replaced by more frankly 
metaphysical concerns among formalist analytic philosophers of mind, it 
was chiefly this would-be metaphysical application of logical 
behaviorism that came increasingly under philosophical scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="Objections &amp; Discussion"></a></p>
<h3><a name="SH2a"></a> a. Technical Difficulties</h3>
<h4><a name="SSH2a.i"></a> i. Action v. Movement</h4>
<p>Ordinary language philosophers were among the first to raise daunting
 difficulties for the strict translationist program which, they argued, 
was guilty of a category mistake -- or at least of wildly 
underestimating the impracticability of what they were proposing -- in 
conflating the concepts of <em>action</em> and <em>movement </em>under 
the heading of "behavior." As D. W. Hamlyn puts this complaint, "where 
activity is exhibited, it is not necessarily inappropriate to talk of 
movements, but it will be so to do so in the same context, in the same 
universe of discourse":</p>
<blockquote><p>With movements we are concerned with physical phenomena, 
the laws concerning which are in principle derivable from the laws of 
physics. But the behaviour which we call "posting a letter" or "kicking a
 ball" involves a very complex series of movements, and the same 
movements will not be exhibited on all occasions on which we should 
describe the behavior in the same way. No fixed criteria can be laid 
down which will enable us to decide what series of movements shall 
constitute "posting a letter." Rather we have learnt to interpret a 
varying range of movements as coming up to the rough standard which we 
observe in acknowledging a correct description of such behaviour as 
posting a letter. (Hamlyn 1953: 134-135)</p></blockquote>
<p>The task of defining mentalistic predications such as "<em>wanting to score a goal</em>" in terms of outward acts -- or dispositions to acts -- like <em>kicking a ball</em>
 (Tolman's "molar behavior") seems daunting enough; the task of casting 
the definition in terms of movements or "molecular behavior" -- 
"colorless movements and mere receptor impulses" (Watson), "motions and 
noises" (Ryle) -- seems beyond daunting.</p>
<h4><a name="SSH2a.ii"></a> ii. From Paralytics to Perfect Actors</h4>
<p>If the mental were completely definable in outwardly behavioral terms
 -- as logical behaviorism proposes -- then outward behavioral 
capacities or dispositions would be <em>necessary</em> for thought or experience. But a complete paralytic, it seems, might still think thoughts (e.g., <em>I can't move</em>), harbor desires (e.g., <em>to move</em>) and experience (e.g., <em>despairing</em>)
 sensations. Such possibilities are, on their face, contrary to logical 
behaviorism. From the logical behaviorist perspective, while such cases 
may complicate the description of the mental in behavioral terms, they 
do not seem fatal. It may be replied, e.g., that <em>wanting to move</em> is being disposed to move <em>if able</em> and, since the various possible causes of the disability (severed spinal cords, curare poisoning, etc.) are <em>physically </em>specifiable,
 this envisaged complication is wholly consistent with behaviorist 
strictures and reductionist hopes. Hilary Putnam's imagined 
super-super-spartans ("<em>X-worlders</em>") are less easily countered. X-worlders (as Putnam called them) "suppress <em>all </em>...
 pain behavior" by "a great effort of will" for "what they regard as 
important ideological reasons" (Putnam 1963: 332-334). Like paralytics, 
these super-super-spartans "lack the behavioral dispositions envisioned 
by the behaviorists to be associated with pain, even though they do in 
fact have pain" (Block 1981: 12); but, unlike paralytics, <em>they</em> lack these dispositions for <em>psychological </em>reasons: efforts of will undertaken for ideological reasons -- unlike severed spinal cords and doses of curare -- would <em>not</em> be physically specifiable and any envisaged complications of the behavioral definitions attempting to build exceptions <em>for these causes</em> would be inconsistent with behaviorist strictures and reductionist hopes. And contrary to the <em>sufficiency</em>
 of behavior for pain that logical behaviorist definitions would imply, 
"an exactly analogous example of perfect pain-pretenders shows that no 
behavioral disposition is <em>sufficient</em> for pain either" (Block 1981: 12: emphasis added).</p>
<h4><a name="SSH2a.iii"></a> iii. The Intentional Circle</h4>
<p><a name="Intentional Circle"></a> Among the technical arguments 
against logical behaviorism, the most influential has been the 
"intentional circle" argument harking back to Chisholm (1957, ch. 11) 
and Geach (1957, p. 8): indeed the perfect actor line of counterexamples
 "flows out of the Chisholm-Geach point" as Block (1981:12) notes. A 
desire to stay dry, for instance, will dispose you to carry an umbrella 
only on the condition that you believe it might rain; and, conversely, 
the belief it might rain will dispose you to carry an umbrella only on 
the condition that you desire to stay dry. Such Geach-Chisholm type 
examples show that "which behavioral dispositions a desire issues in 
depends on other states of the desirer. And similar points apply to 
behaviorist analyses of belief and other mental states" (Block 1981: 
12). While this point is most plain with respect to <em>intentional </em>mental states such as <em>belief </em>and <em>desire, </em>perfect actor examples seem to show it to extend to <em>sensations</em>,
 such as pain, as well: "a disposition to pain behavior is not a 
sufficient condition of having pain, since the behavioral disposition 
could be produced by a number of different combinations of mental 
states, e.g., [pain + a normal preference function] or by [no pain + an 
overwhelming desire to appear to have pain]" (Block 1981: 15); and, 
conversely, the dispositions are not a necessary condition since 
unpained-behavior dispositions might be produced by, e.g. [no pain + a 
normal preference function] or by [pain + an overwhelming desire to 
appear not to have pain]. "Conclusion: one cannot define the conditions 
under which a given mental state will issue in a given behavioral 
disposition" as logical behaviorism proposes "without adverting to <em>other mental states</em>"
 (Block 1981: 12), which logical behaviorism precludes. Such arguments 
are widely "regarded as decisive refutations of behaviorist analyses of 
many mental states, such as belief, desire, and pain" (Block 1981: 13). 
The "functionalist" doctrine that a mental state is "definable in terms 
of its causal relations to inputs, outputs, and other mental states" 
(Block 1980: 257), not to inputs and outputs alone (<em>a la </em>logical behaviorism), also flows directly from the Geach-Chisholm point.</p>
<p>In truth, as Putnam himself notes, whether refutation of the 
"admittedly oversimplified position" of logical behaviorism refutes 
behaviorism <em>tout court</em> depends on the extent to which "the 
defects which this position exhibits are also exhibited by the more 
complex and sophisticated positions which are actually held" (Putnam 
1957: 95). Notably, perfect actor and other would-be <em>thought</em> experimental counterexamples to behaviorism would counterexemplify <em>metaphysical construals</em>
 which those who have actually held "the more complex and sophisticated 
positions" at issue, for the most part, explicitly disavow. Also, 
notably, Ryle's characterization of intentional mental states (in 
particular) as <em>multi-track </em>"dispositions the exercises of which
 are indefinitely heterogenous" (Ryle 1949: 44) seems already to allow 
for intentional "circularity": Tolman and Hull-style behaviorism even 
explicitly embraces it. For refutation of behaviorism <em>tout court</em> to be claimed, cognitivism would be have to be <em>so </em>simply
 identified with the view that a mental state is "definable in terms of 
its causal relations to inputs, outputs, and other mental states" that 
Tolman, Hull, and Ryle, count as cognitivists. That's <em>too </em>simple.
 One may agree "that the logically necessary and sufficient conditions 
for the ascription of a mental state" would have to "refer not just to 
environmental variables but to other mental states of the organism" 
(Fodor 1975: 7 n.7) -- that mental attributions have to be reduced all 
together (or <em>holistically</em>) not one by one (<em>atomistically</em>) -- yet <em>behavioristically</em> refuse the call for further computational (or physical or phenomenological) constraints on <em>what count as</em>
 mental states. The "faith that ... one will surely get to pure 
behavioral ascriptions" -- motions and noises -- "if only one pursues 
the analysis far enough" (Fodor 1975: 7 n.7) is also behavioristically 
dispensable. Notably these two tacks have their costs: the first 
abandons hope for essential scientific characterization of the mental. 
The second abandons hope for reductionist exploitation of behaviorist 
ideas on behalf of materialism. So chastened, behaviorism, while 
defensible, seems, to many, too boring to merit further philosophical 
bother.</p>
<h4><a name="SSH2a.iv"></a> iv. Methodological Complaints</h4>
<p>Fodor's summation of the complaint against against <em>methodological behaviorism</em>
 is succinct: by it, he maintains, "[p]sychology is ... deprived of its 
theoretical terms" meaning "psychologists can provide methodologically 
reputable accounts only of such aspects of behavior as are the effects 
of environmental variables"; but "the spontaneity and freedom from local
 environmental control that behavior often exhibits" makes "this sort of
 methodology intolerably restrictive" (Fodor 1975: 1-2). Furthermore, 
"there would seem to be nothing in the project of explaining behavior by
 reference to mental processes which requires a commitment to [their] 
epistemological privacy in the traditional sense" of conscious 
subjectivity. "Indeed," Fodor continues, "for better or worse, a 
materialist <em>cannot</em> accept such a commitment since his view is 
that mental events are a species of physical events, and physical events
 are publicly observable, at least in principle" (Fodor 1975: 4): the 
commitment is to <em>inner computational not inward experiential</em> 
processes. However, while Fodor 1975 adduces, "failure of behavioristic 
psychology to provide even a first approximation to a plausible theory 
of cognition" (Fodor 1975: 8) in support of <em>cognitivist </em>alternatives,
 Fodor 2000 confesses "that the most interesting -- certainly the 
hardest -- problems about thinking are unlikely to be much illuminated 
by any kind of computational theory we are now able to imagine" (Fodor 
2000: 1). As for more isolated or "modular" processes (e.g., syntactic 
processing) where the "Computational Theory of Mind" by Fodor's lights 
remains "by far the best theory of cognition that we've got; indeed, the
 only one we've got that's worth the bother" (Fodor 2000: 1) ... here, 
where, in Fodor's judgment, behaviorism failed "to provide even a first 
approximation of a plausible theory," cognitivism may be faulted with 
producing <em>too many</em>: elaborate theoretical superstructures built
 on slight observational-experimental foundations reminiscent of Hull's.
 Notably, since Chomsky's watershed "Review of <em>Verbal Behavior</em> 
by B. F. Skinner" Chomsky himself has held at least four distinct 
syntactic theories, and his currently fashionable "Minimalist Theory" 
presently competes with at least five distinct others. (Chomsky's four 
theories (in chronological order) have been <em>Transformational Grammar </em>(1965), <em>Extended Standard Theory </em>(1975), <em>Government and Binding </em>(1984), and <em>Minimalism </em>(1995). Competing theories include, notably, <em>Lexical Function Grammar </em> (Bresnan), <em>Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar </em>(Sag, Pollard), <em>Functionalism</em> (see Newmeyer), <em>Categorial Grammar</em> (Steedman), and <em>Stratificational Grammar </em>(Lamb).)</p>
<h3><a name="SH2b"></a> b. The Ur-Objection: Consciousness Denied</h3>
<p><a name="Ur-Objection"></a> <a name="jokes"></a>Behaviorism's 
disregard for consciousness struck many from the first, and continues to
 strike many today, as contrary to plain self-experience and plain 
common-sense; not to mention all that makes life precious and 
meaningful. In this vein behaviorism has been "likened to `Hamlet' 
without the Prince of Denmark" (Ryle 1949: 328) and behaviorists accused
 of "affecting general anesthesia" (Ogden &amp; Richards 1926: 23) and 
made the butt of jokes in the vein of the following (see Ziff 1958):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Q:</strong> What does one behaviorist say to another when they meet on the street?<br>
<strong>A: </strong>You're fine. How am I?<br>
<strong>Q: </strong>What does one behaviorist say to another after sex?<br>
<strong>A: </strong>That was great for you. How was it for me?</p></blockquote>
<p>In the same vein as John Searle still complains "the behaviorist 
seems to leave out the mental phenomena in question," (Searle 1992: 34),
 E. B. Titchener complained, at the movement's outset, of behaviorism's 
"irrelevance to psychology as psychology is ordinarily understood" 
(Titchener 1914: 6). On the other hand Titchener's prediction -- that, 
due to this irrelevance, introspective psychology would continue to 
flourish <em>alongside</em> behaviorism -- with hindsight, seems a bit 
laughable itself. As Ryle puts it, "the extruded hero," consciousness, 
for scientific purposes, "soon came to seem so bloodless and spineless a
 being that even the opponents of these [behaviorist] theories began to 
feel shy of imposing heavy burdens upon his spectral shoulders" (Ryle 
1949: 328). Ryle's countercomplaint still rings true today despite 
recent attempts to revive consciousness as a subject of serious 
scientific inquiry; or, more to the point especially, in <em>light</em> 
of such attempts, which all, in one way or another, seek to revive the 
Wundtian program of correlating introspected experiential with observed 
neurophysiological events. While it may be urged that the hero was never
 wholly extruded but has been lurking all along in the caves of 
psychophysics (e.g., in correlations of physical stimulus variations 
with <em>noticed </em>differences in <em>sensation</em>), recent attempts to extend this psychology-as-psychophysics approach <em>beyond </em>psychophysics remain nascent at best<em>.</em></p>
<p>"Imagery from Galton on has been the inner stronghold of a psychology
 based on introspection" (Watson 1913: 421) and here, with regard to 
direct sensory presentations (e.g., afterimages) and sensations (e.g., 
pain) -- so-called <em>qualia </em>-- the "neglect of consciousness" 
complaint against behaviorism is most acutely felt; and here it must be 
confessed that behaviorist replies have been mostly halting and evasive.
 Watson, confessing, "I may have to grant a few sporadic cases of 
imagery to him who will not be otherwise convinced" would marginalize 
the phenomena, insisting, "that the images of such a one are as sporadic
 and as unnecessary to his well-being and <em>well-thinking</em> as a 
few hairs more or less on his head" (Watson 1913: 423n.3) -- a verdict 
Ryle deems confirmed. Scientifically, the "extruded hero," it seems, can
 neither <em>explanans </em>nor <em>explanandum</em> be. Inward 
experience seems, scientifically, as nonexplanatory (of intentionality, 
intelligence, or other features of mind we should like to explain) as it
 seems itself scientifically inexplicable. Nevertheless, Ryle frankly 
confesses that "there is something seriously amiss" with his own 
treatment of sensations (Ryle 1949: 240) and, even, "not to know the 
right idioms to discuss these matters" in behavioristic good conscience;
 only hoping, his "discussion of them in the official idioms may have at
 least some internal Fifth Column efficacy" (Ryle 1949: 201). Still, 
inward experiences seem just as unaccountable on inner computational 
grounds as on outward behavioral ones -- Kossyln's 1980 data structural 
analysis of images as two dimensional data arrays, e.g., leaves their <em>qualia </em>still
 unaccounted for. Behavioristic losses on the count of qualia are, by no
 means, cognitivistic gains. Cognitivism itself "has been plagued by two
 `qualia' centered objections" in particular: the Inverted Qualia 
Objection that, possibly, e.g., "though you and I have exactly the same 
functional organization, the sensation that you have when you look at 
red things is phenomenally the same as the sensation that I have when I 
look at green things" (Block 1980: 257); and the Absent Qualia Objection
 "that it is possible that a mental state of a person <em>x </em>be functionally identical to a state of <em>y</em>, even though <em>x</em>'s state <em>has</em> qualitative character while <em>y</em>'s state <em>lacks</em> qualitative character altogether" (Block 1980: 258).</p>
<p>Methodologically, then, the matter of consciousness remains about 
where Watson left it, as scientifically intractable as it seems morally 
crucial and common-sensically inescapable. Unless there is more 
scientific gold in those psychophysical hills than recently renewed 
attempts to mine them by Crick (1994) Edelman (1989) and others (see 
Horgan 1994) suggest, this is apt to be where matters remain for the 
foreseeable future. Notice, <em>metaphysical dualism</em> (identifying 
mental events with private, subjective, nonphysical, "modes" of 
conscious experience) may be held consistently with methodological 
behavioristic commitment to the explanatory superfluity of such factors 
by disallowing such events their apparent causal roles in the generation
 of behavior. <em>Epiphenomenalism </em>denies their causal efficacy altogether. <em>Parallelism </em>just
 denies their "downward" (mental-to-physical) causal efficacy. It is 
due, largely, to their reluctance to embrace such drastic expedients as 
parallelism and epiphenomenalism that, despite recently renewed would-be
 scientific interest in consciousness, most cognitive scientists and 
allied analytic philosophers continue to reject metaphysical dualism -- 
remaining true to their metaphysical, along with their methodological, 
behavioral roots.</p>
<p>The enduring cogency of behaviorism's challenge to the scientific<em> bona fides</em> of consciousness means that <em>methodologically</em>,
 at least, there seems no viable alternative to "practically everybody 
in cognitive science" remaining -- if not "a behaviorist of one sort or 
another" (Fodor 2001: 13-14) -- at least, behavioristic in some manner. 
Cognitive Science killed Behaviorism, they say. Still, Cognitive Science
 seems entitled to its last name only on condition that it retain a good
 measure of behavioristic conscience.</p>

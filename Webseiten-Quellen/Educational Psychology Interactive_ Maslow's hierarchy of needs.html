<p><a href="http://www.wynja.com/personality/theorists_maslow.html">Abraham Maslow</a>
(1954) attempted to synthesize a large body of research related to <a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/motivation/motivate.html">human motivation</a>. Prior to <a href="http://snycorva.cortland.edu/%7EANDERSMD/MASLOW/HOMEPAGE.HTML">Maslow</a>, researchers
generally focused separately on such factors as biology, achievement, or power to explain
what energizes, directs, and sustains human behavior. Maslow posited a <a href="http://www.accel-team.com/maslow_/index.html">hierarchy of human needs</a> based on
two groupings: deficiency needs and growth needs. Within the deficiency needs, each lower
need must be met before moving to the next higher level. Once each of these needs has been
satisfied, if at some future time a deficiency is detected, the individual will act to
remove the deficiency. The first four levels are: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) Physiological: hunger, thirst, bodily comforts, etc.; </p>
  <p>2) Safety/security: out of danger; </p>
  <p>3) Belongingness and Love: affiliate with others, be accepted; and </p>
  <p>4) Esteem: to achieve, be competent, gain approval and recognition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><img src="Educational%20Psychology%20Interactive_%20Maslow%27s%20hierarchy%20of%20needs-Dateien/maslow.gif" height="380" width="576"> </p>

<p>According to Maslow, an individual is ready to act upon the growth needs if and only if
the deficiency needs are met. Maslow's initial conceptualization included only one growth
need--self-actualization. Self-actualized people are characterized by: 1) being
problem-focused; 2) incorporating an ongoing freshness of appreciation of life; 3) a
concern about personal growth; and 4) the ability to have peak experiences. Maslow later <a href="http://www.theosophy-nw.org/theosnw/human/hu-sbd.htm">differentiated the growth need
of self-actualization,</a> specifically identifying two of the first growth needs 
as part of the more
general level of self-actualization (Maslow &amp; Lowery, 1998) and one beyond the 
general level
that focused on growth beyond that oriented towards self (Maslow, 1971). They are: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5) Cognitive: to know, to understand, and explore; </p>
  <p>6) Aesthetic: symmetry, order, and beauty; </p>
  <p>7) <a href="http://personcentered.com/selfact.html">Self-actualization</a>: to find
  self-fulfillment and realize one's potential; and </p>
  <p>8) <a href="http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/%7Egreg.c/psych.html">Self-transcendence</a>: to 
  connect to something beyond the ego or to help
  others find self-fulfillment and realize their potential.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maslow's basic position is that as one becomes more <a href="http://www.cop.com/tw-ch01.html">self-actualized and self-transcendent</a>, one becomes
more wise (develops wisdom) and automatically knows what to do in a wide variety of
situations. <a href="http://www.mdani.demon.co.uk/archive/MDMaslow.htm">Daniels</a> 
(2001) suggested that Maslow's ultimate conclusion that the highest levels of 
self-actualization are transcendent in their nature may be one of his most 
important contributions to the study of human behavior and motivation.</p>

<p>Norwood (1999) proposed that Maslow's hierarchy can be used to describe the
kinds of information individual's seek at different levels of development. For example,
individuals at the lowest level seek <b>coping information</b> in order to meet
their basic needs. Information that is not directly connected to helping a
person meet his or her needs in a very short time span is simply left
unattended. Individuals at the safety level need <b>helping information</b>.
They seek to be assisted in seeing how they can be safe and secure. <b>Enlightening
information</b> is sought by individuals seeking to meet their belongingness
needs. Quite often this can be found in books or other materials on relationship
development. <b>Empowering information</b> is sought by people at the esteem
level. They are looking for information on how their egos can be developed.
Finally, people in the growth levels of cognitive, aesthetic, and
self-actualization seek <b>edifying information</b>. While Norwood does not
specifically address the level of transcendence, I believe it is safe to say that
individuals at this stage would seek information on how to connect to something 
beyond themselves or to how others could be edified. </p>

<p>Maslow published his first conceptualization of his theory over 50 years ago (Maslow,
1943) and it has since become one of the most popular and often cited theories of human
motivation. An interesting phenomenon related to Maslow's work is that in spite of a lack
of empirical evidence to support his hierarchy, it enjoys wide acceptance (Wahba &amp; Bridgewell,
1976; Soper, Milford &amp; Rosenthal, 1995). </p>

<p align="left">The few major studies that have been completed on the hierarchy seem to
support the proposals of <a href="http://www.emory.edu/EDUCATION/mfp/james.html">William
James</a> (1892/1962) and Mathes (1981) that there are three levels of human needs.
James hypothesized the levels of material (physiological, safety), social (belongingness,
esteem), and <a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/spiritual/spirit.html">spiritual</a>. Mathes proposed the three levels were
physiological, belonginess, and self-actualization; he considered security and self-esteem
as unwarranted. Alderfer (1972) developed a comparable hierarchy with his ERG (existence,
relatedness, and growth) theory. His approach modified Maslow's theory based on the work
of <a href="http://www.ship.edu/%7Ecgboeree/allport.html">Gordon Allport </a>(1960, 1961)
who incorporated concepts from <a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/artsci.html">systems theory</a> into his
work on <a href="http://www.ship.edu/%7Ecgboeree/persintro.html">personality</a>.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Maslow recognized that not all personalities followed his proposed hierarchy. While a
variety of personality dimensions might be considered as related to motivational needs,
one of the most often cited is that of
<a href="http://keirsey.com/pumII/ei.html">introversion
and extroversion</a>. Reorganizing Maslow's hierarchy based on the work of Alderfer and
considering the introversion/extraversion dimension of personality results in three
levels, each with an introverted and extroverted component. This organization suggests
there may be two aspects of each level that differentiate how people relate to each set of
needs with different personalities relating more to one dimension than the other. For
example, an introvert at the level of Other/Relatedness might be more concerned with his
or her own perceptions of being included in a group, whereas an extrovert at that same
level would pay more attention to how others value that membership. &nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">At this point there is little agreement about the identification of <a href="http://www.itstime.com/jun97.htm">basic human needs</a> and how they are ordered.
For example, Ryan &amp; Deci (2000) also suggest three needs, although they are not
necessarily arranged hierarchically: the need for autonomy, the need for competence, and the need for
relatedness. <span lang="en-us">Thompson, Grace and Cohen (2001) state the most 
important needs for children are connection, recognition, and power. Nohria, Lawrence, 
and Wilson (2001) provide evidence from a sociobiology theory of motivation that 
humans have four basic needs: (1) acquire objects and experiences; (2) bond with 
others in long-term relationships of mutual care and commitment; (3) learn and 
make sense of the world and of ourselves; and (4) to defend ourselves, our loved 
ones, beliefs and resources from harm. The Institute for Management Excellence 
(2001) suggests there are nine basic human needs: (1) security, (2) adventure, 
(3) freedom, (4) exchange, (5) power, (6) expansion, (7) acceptance, (8) 
community, and (9) expression.</span></p>

<p align="left"> <span lang="en-us">Notice that bonding and relatedness are a 
component of every theory. However, there do not seem to be any others that are 
mentioned by all theorists. </span>Franken (<span lang="en-us">2001</span>) suggests this lack of accord may be a result of different
philosophies of researchers rather than differences among human beings. In addition, he
reviews research that shows a person's <a href="http://www.psych.upenn.edu/seligman/asq.htm">explanatory or attributional style</a>
will modify the list of basic needs. Therefore, it seems appropriate to ask people what
they want and how their needs could be met rather than relying on an unsupported theory.
For example, Waitley (1996) advises having a person imagine what life would be 
like if time and money were not an object in a person's life. That is, what 
would the person do this week, this month, next month, if he or she had all the money 
and time needed to engage in the activities and were secure that both would be 
available again next year. With some follow-up questions to identify what is 
keeping the person from engaging in these activities at the present time, this open-ended approach is likely to 
identify the most important needs of the individual.</p>

<p align="left">There is much work still to be done in this area before we can rely on a theory to be more
informative than simply collecting and analyzing data. However, this body of research can
be very important to parents, educators, administrators and others concerned with
developing and using human potential. It provides an outline of some important issues that
must be addressed if human beings are to achieve the levels of character and competencies
necessary to be successful in the <a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/papers/conceptual_age_s.doc">information/conceptual age</a> 
(Huitt, 2007). Huitt's (2006) "<a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/brilstar/index.html">Becoming 
a Brilliant Star</a>" framework is intended to provide a framework to discuss 
the needs of children and youth across three core elements and ten domains. </p>
